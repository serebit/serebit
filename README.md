### Who am I?

I'm Campbell (also known as serebit), and I build software that I hope can be useful to others.

### Why are all my repositories mirrors?

Because I prefer GitLab, but want to push to GitHub as well for discoverability purposes.

### How can I be contacted?

I tend to avoid making my email address public to reduce spam. If you'd like to contact me by email, use the contact form on my website [here](https://serebit.com/contact/). It'll send an email to my main inbox, and I'll respond as soon as I'm able.
